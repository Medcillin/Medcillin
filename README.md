<h4>👀 I'm starting my coding/Github journey this year 2024~ <br>
  🌱 I'll be starting with some personal projects. Hopefully I'll update steady incremental improvements.<br>
  🍄 Ask me about projects having to do with Health and medicine. <br>
  🥺 I'm looking for help with improving any of my code, I'm always open to learn!<br>
